# Welcome to our examples!

You need to configure some minor things to get started with menus in XP.

* First: Install this library in your app
* Second: Add one of the mixins from `/_examples/x-data/` - follow the [guide for mixins](x-data/readme.md) for this!
* Third: Add your controller code and view code - follow the [guide for views](views/readme.md) for this!

Note that we ship this library with Thymeleaf fragments built-in, they can be used without copy and pasting any view examples.
